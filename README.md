## Data and Accuracy

Our model is based on a robust dataset collected from 28,886 surveys conducted as part of the **Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF)** in 2019. The accuracy of our algorithm stands at an impressive 92%, ensuring reliable and personalized recommendations.

## Optimal Portfolio

We employ the **Markowitz Efficient Frontier Optimization** algorithm to compute an optimal investment portfolio. This approach has been optimized and improved by an astonishing 23% compared to the original 1950 model. The resulting portfolio consists of a combination of 5 stocks listed on the **S&P 500**.

## Future

Our commitment is to continue enhancing and expanding our services. We are working on future updates that will enable the system to create combinations with stock indices from around the world and offer a broader range of investment instruments, including funds, bonds, royal state, and more.

Thank you for choosing our platform! We look forward to assisting you in making informed and successful financial decisions.
